/// A thread pool for executing tasks. Tasks are futures that are being automatically driven by
/// the pool on threads owned by the pool.

/// # Scheduling Semantics
/// Each thread in the pool is assigned to one of three priority groups: Compute, IO, and Async
/// Compute. Compute is higher priority than IO, which are both higher priority than async compute.
/// Every task is assigned to a group upon being spawned. A lower priority thread will always prioritize
/// its specific tasks (i.e. IO tasks on a IO thread), but will run higher priority tasks if it would
/// otherwise be sitting idle.
///
/// For example, under heavy compute workloads, compute tasks will be scheduled to run on the IO and
/// async compute thread groups, but any IO task will take precedence over any compute task on the IO
/// threads. Likewise, async compute tasks will never be scheduled on a compute or IO thread.

/// via [`TaskPoolBuilder`] when constructing the pool.
